However the fact that every other app out there is paid I didn’t want to commit as I might not have liked it.

Overall, it’s a perfect app. It has many courses which are perfect for people starting meditation like I used to be as it teaches you everything you need to know and you’ll pick up the skill very quickly. 

It’s a great app made by great people.

Consider donating to them if you want things fixed faster :)",text,related,https://itunes.apple.com/gb/review?id=1500780518&type=Purple%20Software,0,Application,Application,0,2023-04-18T17:08:11-07:00,Copyright 2008 Apple Inc.,iTunes Store: Customer Reviews,http://itunes.apple.com/favicon.ico,next,,https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/customerreviews/page=2/id=1500780518/sortby=mostrecent/xml?urlDesc=/customerreviews/id=1500780518/sortBy=mostRecent/json,https://mzstoreservices-int-st.itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/customerreviews/id=1500780518/sortBy=mostRecent/json
